# Detained
The United States immigration detention system is the largest it has ever been. There are over 1,600 detention centers, tens of thousands of people in detention on a daily basis and millions of dollars in taxpayer monies flowing to local governments and private companies alike. For the most part, detainees are being held for violating a federal law against illegal entry. The Trump administration says we must hold them until an immigration judge decides their fate. But there are problems: detainees are dying, children are being separated from their families, and conditions inside the facilities are worsening.

Using documentary filmmaking and data visualization, "[Detained](LINK)", published on September XX, 2019, tells the origin story of immigrant detention in the United States, of the immigration system that Donald Trump inherited and  its subsequent transformation.

Included in this repo are the [detention](LINK) and [apprehensions](LINK) data that [The Marshall Project](LINK) used to show how the detained population and apprehensions have changed over the past three decades.

If you'd like to use the data, please read on to understand its provenance.

# Data Sources and Methodology

To compile this data, we had to dig through decades of government files dating back to the 1960s, when the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not exist.

The bulk of the data came from House Committee on Appropriations budget hearing documents. We also used reports and documents published in the Department of Homeland Security Library archives, in addition to enforcement reports published online by the Department of Homeland Security. The apprehensions data came from the Customs and Border Patrol website, where they publish data tables and arrest reports. Lastly, we also collected data from reports published by the Congressional Research Service, the research arm of Congress.

Despite our best attempts, there are still a few gaps in the data. (Mostly between 1995 and 2000.) Nevertheless, the bulk of the data we gathered allow us to reveal overarching trends in the detention system.
